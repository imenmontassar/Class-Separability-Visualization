# Class-Separability-Visualization

In this notebook, we will analyze the iris datasets, and demonstrate the separation of the different classes using two methods.

The first method is based on the calculus of the inter-distance of each class and intra-distance between two classes. To calculate distance, we will use two metrics, the first is the Euclidean distance and the second is the Mahalanobis distance.

The second method is based on visualization techniques including histograms and scatter plots.
